Two key features we have implemented are:<br /><br />4x4 Block Schedule:<br /><br />Tilden students take 4 classes per semester and earn 1 full credit at the end of the semester.This college-like structure allows students to earn 8 credits per year instead of 7 at other schools. Students have more room in their schedule to take AP courses, Dual Credit Courses, or participate in work-study programs.<br /><br />Convergence Academy:<br /><br />Tilden is no longer a turnaround school, we are a Convergence Academy.
